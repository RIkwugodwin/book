    <em>NOTHING IS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN RISKING EVERTHING FOR NOTHING</em>
   <h1> LIFE</h1>
    <h5> LIFE 
        This is weighing ways more than the wave of the sea swore; it is all about the experience we face, we still have breath in us. The heart still travelling with blood through the vain produce by the bone marrow. Life is a journey, it mirrors our existence as literature, and it is a two-side coin of humanity.
        See the sea beyond the rock for there is the source of the waters. Life isn’t about the breath only but the content of the existence that consist in the breath we make. Life is that material that is use to make more material, life is all about you, yourself, your choice and the matter of element that grow in you. 
        Every day is a page we open towards life, a challenge and hustle. Very often our shadow only prints the dark print of our original self but the joy is you can't change it rather you live with it and learn every day. So, try each day to write well and clean on the present page and stop reading the pages of others and copy their error. "Just be you".
        The debt of our future is the cause of most depression think creak the head a lot on the fact that we have to pay back what we did not take.
        Pick up that foot mate that lay down on your door step dust the sand on it you will find nothing but the very sand that your sandal and shoes brought to the house by yourself
        You can’t continue wishing for cake when you are serves with bread and your money can only effort biscuit hold on to that bread of yours find the cake owner and share the bread with him so as to get the cake you wish for, for yourself
        Get the razor blade cut off your hair and plant in the soil that is heavily fill with nutrient water it, safe guided it monitor it then plant the hair for it to grown wait after twelve years go back to the piece you  buried all you will find is that same pieces of hair you plant it will only change in the texture but is still your hair even if you creamy it with the most expensive hair creamy it will only be more shining and dark more the color texture you want it will never grow while on the soil the is water and fertile, so don’t worry yourself of achieved the hole when you are not ready to leave your comfort zone to struggle to make it happen.
        No matter the growth of your hair it can never grow more the iroko tree in the forest so don’t picture yourself been problem free for problem is the twin to solution you can’t make it if you have not face problem.
        We all are so scared of what is unknown, running from our shadow forgetting that our shadow is only cast when they are light so good things always spring out from bad thing.
        We worry about everything when she is just another virtue of something. We take our mistake seriously not knowing that we need to miss a step so as to take another. We are so clone to fear that we allow our greater part and ability to join our ancestors making the grave yard the richness place in the planet. Yes, problem is the virtues that keep the planet in continue process, do you problem in life yes can you do something about it yes then why worry, and do you problem in life no can you do something about it now then why worry, do you problem in life yes can you do something about it now then why worry, do you problem in life no can you do something about it yes then worry. No matter the situation of your worry in life, life can’t be change from the unique nature it was created for, free yourself from doubt and see the better part of you
        This is one word that families use often that Life is not fail, to every human that word cannot be ignorance word to use that such word existence. People are quite richer than what their face that does not mean that life is an imbalance nomenclature or beyond the two-coin side of a coin, these might look as if it is only face by the things, they see yet the thing they don’t. It plays a role of a dilemma, a boy sitting on a fence. Life is a twist, every night and day is a dream, some time is so sweet some time ugly 
        The nature of the existence of things in the planet is still a mystery hence your problem is only a mystery that you cannot tell how your problem came about but problems are they for humanity.
        Everybody wants success and never see failure as an enemy yet failure is a necessary end but failure most existence to build up success, the problem we face are the accessory to life existence the problem might existence until thousands of generation yet one can’t forgo problem. Socially problems have several categories either it is a mental embargo. In the ancient time, the time of gods and magic when mortal was alien cruel and plague mankind with suffering, power was the order of the day, when great things were in existence, a time life is felt as a place for the strong not on our generation that it is seen as advancement of technology.
        Spirit and brave mortals scrabble for supremacy; men rumble for victories and brevity, when real men were tested with muscle wresting or battle, the weak were use as slaves in the homes of the rich.
        Prophecy where the hope to mankind, men stumble over power to control the nature of life and dominate the narrow bullet of the breath which exist just but a moment, ironically this thing continues generation to the next until our generation of jealousy and greed, the generation that money is valve over life. The question is; who will speak, who will correct the wrong that is already in existence, who will answer the call, who shall be the voice of the people.
        Nothing changes until century of year where the thunder travel from the axis and the mountain were forsh, trees grow, nature were weaves to the beautiful gallery of civilization of the planet the discovery of new things nature as globalization which is now a village for all to browser upon on it, we own unity.
         Through the road of hustle we behold the arrows of struggle just to face the fear of the unknown, the man that stand as the embargo to the journey were the key of success in found, we are clone to the world of doom if we do not make the right choice of life, life is not mounted on the success story we achieved perhaps every story have a history and every history have a creator and every creator must have a creation to account for his works, life is the price we pay to stay in the place of the living, where we pay price of seeing the unjust doing nothing and the just fighting to become the unjust, people scramble to gain power and authority to do the things that no one have done breaking the records that have been set down by mortal who the world worship.
        Human attribute life to be unfair but life is the duplicate of what we give to it; you can’t be a dog and give birth to a monkey or a lion.
        The harrow, narrow road to the hills is the dream of the mind where every being climb to get but when it is not worked upon it become the faded the picture that lies between the night and the imagination machine of the string bed which wrestle on the night, the night that grows on the part to the vision that was only gotten from the sleep that men have when they lay their head on the rest of the bed that accommodate the unseen blessing of the night, the impossible venture to the wall of success. 
        Many have come to this world were the brave are seen on the part of not giving up to the challenge that they have been in existence to be face by men who want to achieved.
         What we want in the stay flow of wealth on the world it is not just to be successful but to live a fulfil life hence the number of period mortals spend in world is far shorter than the time spent in the grave, a home of credible people who never exhausted their potential while they live on earth as human.
        The nature of life is full of with ups and down but the struggle still comes on, giving up is not an exception to life struggle it is the beginning of every journey to every legacy fight to achieved the aim in which man is born to face the nature which we are to face as people.
        Life is a journey that brings forth good things to the heart that has good luck.
        We are the world that everything is about struggle, hustle, fighting that is one phenomenon that define us, that is the nature of life, but most often people are cripple in the ignorance fight for the unknown that they feel is the best for them which I quote as fear.
        
        WHAT IS LIFE
        Life is the mirror that reflect us on the world of wanders, it is that short moment that you breathe, it is that point the air in the nostril freely move to the lungs, that is naturally created make available by the creator. Life is the point in the existence that thing seem to occur or in the appearance of men that eyes can behold.
        Logically Life is one of the valuable commodities that humanity fight to protect because there are accessories to form part of life
        She is not the number of things you acquired that makes life unique, those are accessory to life? That aim at the smooth running of the breath that is provided by the maker of every good thing. A situation may occur in every point in time such as; doom, anger, huger name it, at some point one may gain; Cars, houses, cloths, shoes, phones, husband, wife, children, wealth. At most moment the human tries to define himself as a success man but this are accessory to the nature or the master called life.
        Each moment in one’s life is a machine to humanity to cherish we think we a super, we are the master of our own but this is not is just the grace from the creator. The inner self is more expensive and demanding than the outer self so as the inner life that need more attention than the outer life, the Bible teach us the feed the food for the soul than the food we feed the fresh for to dust it shall return but the soul in eternal. The life here beyond is the tool for taught
