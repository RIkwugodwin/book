    <em>NOTHING IS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN RISKING EVERTHING FOR NOTHING</em>
    <h1> CHOICE </h1>

    <h5>CHOICE
        Choice is that double age driver who drives same car, same time, same rage, in the same spot with different wheel to move with. Choices operate as an attribute of our life, it determined the manner we eat, the character we possess, the ‘will’ play of our zeal. The speeches we use is trigger by the attitude we put toward the choices we make hence attitude is everything and attribute that serves as the accessories of life. These are the product of our mind, the mind that is clone by our thought and it is enhance by that power that control our activities which is power by the power house of our choices that served as the inner human, as humans in the world where we hustle to make ends meet on the world of our self, Choice occupy ninety percent of our begin in the world, even the planet in design as a product of choice, its decision is rule by the power of choice which lives and depend on our thought of it.
        The metal race we face daily is the very point of our existence to appreciation the native creativity that God have in creating his people which he calls us his own, that he created us in his own image and likeness. 
        It is the moment that you are face with two stage actors that opt to present their ability in the same way and manner The gentle and confuse man called ‘choice’ is one man that can be smiling and at the same time crying, playing, singing, dancing, watching, drinking all at the same space of time, the  engine controlling every nature in the existence of humanity is the fact that the world is growing to a particular direction, this direction coin us to a part where it seen to support our metal self and the social life of our existence giving us a hope of another future, a future that might not hold forth if not properly selected or chosen, it draw us a printed wall a path that has many ups and downs yet can be achieved. Choice captivates a good prospect of our begin, it is that double age driver who drive same car at the same time.
        I was confronted by a child on my way to school with an assignment on her hands which she need help, with the look on her face tells me that she is going to be seriously punish if the assignment was not done, me on the other hands was already running late for lectures and the assignment I was face with seem difficult to answer just easily, at the instance I was face with several choice to play with; either to reject helping and go for my lecture, not to be send out of the hall for coming late or to allow the child to go more sad than ever and not to embarrassed myself of not telling her that the assignment looks difficult to solve perhaps she came knowing dig in her heart that I will be able to solve the work for her, all I did was to smile at her and tell her not to worry that I will do the assignment for her but I was running late for schooling, her reply motivate me of doing it for her, she said if it means she joining me to the school and have her assignment done not mining her being flock for late at the assemble compound  at that instance I become surprise for her thought of receiving punishment just to make sure her assignment was done. I held back, I sat down and got her assignment fix for her. Two things happen to me that day, first was not to give up on the issue am face with I should keep trying, secondly was that I learnt something new which was not just enough, rather me saving a depress child from been flock. At the end of me getting to school I discover the lecturer was cancel, and the assignment of the little girl was the Childs assessment which she has gave some few fellows to help her but prove abortive.
        The virtue here was a child facing several persons to help her with her work yet nothing happens until she met me one good thing was that she never gave up no matter the disappointment she met, the several people she met to have had it done. Some of us get tired of trying even if we feel too big or small to required help from people and even asking for help, for one will take it so hard not to continue, am not talking about begging for arms or financial help am talking of the metal, physical, psychological, spiritual, motivating help you get from others to achieved yours (positive wan, though negative thought also play a role in our life too).
        Choices is that attribute of life that smile at the same time cry, ‘no pain no gain’
        These virtues grow to become the product of our mind, and is enhance by the cup that accommodate the heart that cares, as humans, in the world that determined the manner we dress and walk from the way we are inside, the planet where we make choices to keep the world rolling, we criticize others in what they do, blaming others for the wrong actions, character they possess which we take pleasure of been their audience. We are clone to the world of making choice; choice is one designer that separates us from other creatures of the earth. Choice is the mind essence of our begin, navigating from the biblical version of the creation of the earth, scientifically we are that human beginning starts from the fertilization of the sperm with the woman ovary which develop into embryo to infant to a child etc at every stage in life you make choices and in different manner and reason behind each choice we take either positive or negative, choice start playing from that moment our parent thought of having you as a child.
        Like Dale Carnegie will say ‘let’s realize that criticism is like homing the pigeon’. They will always return to the home they left behind, on the turn to blame other remember you too share the blame.  
        We are all master to our world no matter the social, individual differences we are heroes to our little capacity, we are Amazon to greater thing, we are the artist to our life, we are the challenger and the challenge that we most face, we are who we are.
        A novelist once said; Art is man’s constant effort created for himself a different order of reality from that which is given to him (prof. Chinua Achebe) 
        All action we take lies on our attitudes which depend on our choice of life. Choice has its own negative and positive impact on us as human and nature. 
        The way we do things, the way we reason all this depends on the choices we make, A maxim statement goes money is the root of all evil and it make the world to go round which culminates into another wise saying by Adam Smith in the 16th century 1776, Thus human wants are insatiable, the ‘question now goes those that are poor and still perpetuate evil, does money make them to do evil’? The evil we possess is the inner voice (choice) that we often listen when we are face with duties of good and bad or two taught
        This is only possible to the hearts that follow the dance of the music of the money that makes them do evil; evil is the dragon that controls a man in order to conceive the thought of doing things that is not good to the greater percentage of humanity.  
        Many may argue that money make the world to go round perhaps the study of geography never review that the earth rotates with the help of money, right from the creation day of the world the world has been going round in the way that it was design to not by the help of money. The money here is just the accessories to life betterment
        Everything we do as human is what we believe on; that is manifested the way we dream of it as such everybody is the attribute of his own problems, himself and the future. Thousand-time people advance to the Diviners and pastors for prayers to foreseen their destiny, what the future holds for but is funny to note that this people can’t even solve their own family problems rather another assistant from a third party is involved in the process, we all are the architect of our own problems, we are design for that purpose at that period of time, accept the faith, work with the enthusiasm that is the challenge but is for a moment.
        Ola Rotimi once said that ‘the struggle of a man begins at birth’ to this fact it simply means that whatever you want you should fight for it then this will draw your cotton to the choices you will take in the race of life that you will face in the period that you will live in the planet. This choice defines you; it builds you, give you, it paints you a picture of the inhabitant that you are really are.
        Choices operate as an attribute of our life, a key drummer to our heart hence attitude is everything, the manner, the character, the speech that examined us. These are the product of our mind the mind that clone our thought and it is enhanced by that motivation that control our activities, as humans in the world where we hustle to make ends meet, Choice occupy ninety percent of our begin in the world, even the planet is design as a product of choice, its decision is rule by the power of choice which we live and depend on it, as I illustrated previously.
        Choice works like a mental drummer deciding which to keep and which to let go, which to build and which to fake, the path to dwell either negative or positive. Making choices is not the problem but to fight the choice that you have already made is the issue that required story from the gods. Is it positive to you and negative to people that live around you or is it negative to you and positive to the people around you? 
        Independent nations, were once fought for by the people, they did scrabble for power to have their own sovereignty, power to rule her people. This was the choice of her leaders that took a struggle to have an independent nation. Nelson Mandela of South African spend twenty-seven year in the prison as a prisoner for his own country was as the result that he knows the right of is people and took a choice to suffer for it not minding his family and the problems he will face they of, Dr. Martin Cooper of USA in 1973 invented a cell phone as a result of quest for good communication system in the world and the easy passing of information between people of far distance, Karl Benz of Germany in 1885 invented a car to the people of Germany now is the tool that is aiding the transportation system of the universe that is now advance to various model, types and with powerful design but this is the idea of one man the choice of a single brain.
        The gentle and confuse man called ‘choice’ is one man that can be smiling and at the same time be crying, playing, singing, dancing, watching, drinking all at the same space of time, the  engine controlling every nature in the existence of humanity is the fact that the world is growing to a particular direction, this direction coin us to a part where it seen to support our metal self and the social life of our existence giving us a hope of another future, a future that might not hold front if not properly selected or chosen, it draw us a printed wall a path that has many ups and downs yet can be achieved.
        we criticize others in what there do, blaming others for the wrong action character there possess which we take pleasure of been their audience. We are clone to the world of making choice; choice is one designer that separates us from other creature of the earth. Choice is the mind essence of our begin, navigating from the biblical version of the creation of the earth, scientifically we are taught that human beginning starts from the fertilization of the sperm with the woman ovary which develop into embryo to infant to a child etc. at every stage in life you make choices and in different manner and reason behind each choice we take either positive or negative, choice start playing from that stage where your parent taught of aborting you or not
        Choice is one continue process that keep on happening daily as you wake from your bed, each time you make a choice it should link to the pervious choice you have taken to maintain continuity, that does not mean it should be totally as the previous one you have taken but it must have a linking point. A point where the positive aspect on the pervious choice taken will prove itself, Choice manifest itself better when the backup choices synchronize when the pervious, when this two have a role to play in each other, not fully independent but help the other choice to make a great outcome. That does mean, you most take a choice that has something linking to the pervious in most cases we opt to take a choice that has nothing to do with the pervious that is in the case of environment, emotion, people and age. Why have these had to show up is because your environment has a role to play in the choice to make, your emotion play another greater role, the people around you and the age you are into has another greater key unlock the player of choice in us. While as a child our hopes are very high been dependent on our parent to give us ideas, something to stand with but the ignorant choice we make while as infant is often consider as temporary, when age count us among the teenagers our choice has to count on that category most time not changing from the ones our parents has set for us. 
        Be it as it may some genius kid make great choices even though as teenagers, as we advance to adult our choices change from the ones we make while we were still babies, like wise when we get to adulthood and midlife. “We are too old to be a child and too young to be a man” (T.D Jakes).
        Choice is the communication with the inner human it is the mediator with the spirit of the soul, Communication in the time of the invention is one way tool, been as old as man communication has a vital role to play in the decision, we made perhaps we interact with our inner self. As communication advances is became a two-way tool where feedback mechanism become necessary, were we get instant response from our self that is to say that if our inner human speak our outer human play to the gallery
        Many scholars who have given their numerous definitions to the concept choice, oxford dictionary defined Choice as an act of choosing between two or more possibilities.
        As earlier interacted with Nkawu Philip who has devote his time and all his study space to be a successful man, According to Nkawu Philip He sees choice as that state of being in the fence of two decisions. Fencing your building is not only to protect you from thief but also the secure your privacy from settle eyes from knowing the activities that take place in our home.
        To my ideology, I define it as you, it is your mental self-design on the physical self-manifestation, it is the actualization of the dream, vision that is nurture in the heart of the human and animals. It is the inner speaker that rings the bell when we are face with second thought, it is the drummer that has the drum strike to beat any time we are face by Mr. Challenge, the ‘you’ in ‘you’ is the manifest of the heart out come, the teacher of decision.
        Choice is like the stadium that players play football, in the field during the football match we are faced with two main challenge either to win or lose, twenty-two player running after one man which is Mr. Ball, two coaches deciding the faith of the team, extra players sitting waiting to be called upon, audience watching, fans shouting for her players, media men and cameras running towards each player to get the best shot, referee running after the ball and the player to make a fail judgment, the ball running from one foot to the other, the commentator doing their thing, the gamblers betting,  but the key word here is who will win and who will lose or is the match going to be a draw match, obviously all this personnel are just looking toward the direction of the ball. The Chain, challenge, choice, (the life) these are the three key words one has in mind; “Win, Lose and draw”. 
        Everything in the field is importance to the match to be successful but some seem so importance than the others perhaps that is the BALL (challenge, chain, choice) without this Life is not appreciated, the choice we make either negative or positive, value that moment you took the decision because this will stand a taste of time when needed
        
        CHOICE YOU HAVE TAKEN
        HOW TO KNOW THE CHOICE YOU HAVE TAKEN
        Many scholars have given their various way of viewing the concept Choice, choice act as the way we behalf and the way you reason even identical twin can’t weigh on the same choice in life. Some have given a vivid look on the concept and the way of making a right choice in life. Two fellows act the same in one choice there might pick same choice in life but have their own various way of achievement for instance; Starting a just course, later turning to the very negative of our reason (The Nigeria #ENDSAR protest which came as fight to end injustice and the bad government a peaceful protest but later on was engineer by bad sword that made it a bloody protest.) At setting point in life, the decision and choices we made may make us to wonder, should I continue or stay, why this thing?  hence the joy is you never gave up. The misplacing of this words is ignorantly use by people some mistake choice to Desire, Talent and Decision, although these two concepts are wrongly place but there has different way they are acted upon.
        According to the oxford dictionary defined Choice as an act of choosing between two or more possibilities, Desire is a strong quest or wish to have or do something, Decision is the choosing or taking an action to act upon while Talent is a nature gift by the creator. How this work if you are talented on music and your enthusiasm makes you to desire to be a musician, the curiosity made you to make decision to be a musical artist, the focus, time and devotedness in this career made you made the choice to join in the line of music.
        Our choice is partly influence by the temperament we possess, the fact remains that there is no single prefect choice for each time we make a decision of a choice it most have a pit hoe just as the entrepreneur who take moderate risk, he has the motion that he is taking a risk but a moderate risk so as the choice we make, each step we take is risky but we must take the risk. Every rational man has one point of risk to another to take in the world where you risk to die, the risk to be successful, the risk to fit in, in the contemporary society where everything is worth fighting for
        To a closer look at decision that share same element with choice, to choose perhaps is choice and decision, choice is far beyond that which people think of it; knowing our desire can’t be our choice because our desire in driven by emotions, for instance our intention of becoming academician or out spoken, like great men that speak very well does not make you one rather you are aspirating to be like somebody that you cannot talk about because of his or her integrity may drive you to be like him or her
        Note: People inward character is not the same as the outward character, “human is highly known as copycat”.
        In a simply explanation of the different concept; It is only desire hearts that drive us to be like that fellow that we to be like, which does not make you that person, choice works in accordance with nature and yourself, “this was a thought”, the risk that you have not understood, the things we will face along the line as we take a trip through our destiny achievement, is still a mystery that you will never understand except you are on the race.
        Some have taken choice as a talent but talent is an inbuilt element, a supernatural gift possesses by one without any lesson or training gotten from any means, talent is that which we display from our inner self so is not the outer possession but that which the heart work in accordance with for a perfect combination that we produce a better fulfillment of what the heart feels, the body, our emotions, psychological, physical frame work that we toil with, then definitely that is not choice.
        The choice of another person cannot be yours; two humans cannot possess same choice select, two identical twins can stand before you and these twins cannot make same choices. The true is we are easily influence with the choices of our friends or family’s member who opt to help us to abide to, in the manner that best suit them or the attitude of our peers which can control our choices,
        Note that the people character or choice can only add to our own idea to make us a perfect choice out of what we want, it will be pleased you to know that there is no perfect choice ever, all choice we make has one form of disadvantage to the other, either negative or positive but the good thing we should learn from it that everything happens for a reason or it happen for the better understanding of nature or the existence of life better, may be to see the better version of yourself. 
        Knowing your choice deserved an ethical thinking, a careful mind to think better.
        •	Thinking is one examination that is not easily pass, thinking is one tool that can give you both bad and good outcome perhaps thinking is guided by two gods (evil and good).
        •	Thinking is one author of his own, she writes with two biros and she write fast than the best human writer. With the two pens she writes without making any mistake in the various topics she wants to write upon.
        •	Thinking is one man that can course psychological drummer, emotional problem, heart attack, high blood pressure name it. Think is known for himself as a great man that all humans employ his services
        Knowing the choice to take is just as entrepreneur who will brain storm on opportunities, ideas then come with conclusion he wants to work with and try his best to achieved the idea, goal gotten early, he will never be afraid of the risk taken hence he takes moderate risk, he is not afraid of failure because he sees failure as a strength to work on. All great men and women who have attend wealth, power, authority, command for emotional influence, war lords, have attended the seminar that failure have serve them but there break through seeing it as a curse of blessing. Do not judge me by my successes, judge me by the number of times I fell down and I got up again, (Nelson Mandela speak), often we are focus on people success story not knowing what it took them to ascertain that height there are now. 
        When you take your time to analyze the failure and suffering every man took and the choices there made at each point and how far the decision drove with them; it can help you to learn the techniques you need to have to achieve yours.
        KNOW YOUR CHOICE
        STEPS TO FOLLOW TO KNOW YOUR CHOICE IF RIGHT OR WRONG
        The following might not be the perfect apparatus for you to work upon but stand as an idea to work, as a tool one need to be guided with, to make a good thing out of himself after he has taken a choice he wants to work with. Is obvious that choice is the activities of the mind that work with visual slight, the eyes portray to the soul, to feed the feeling of the fresh, which no medical hospital can treated the illment of choice, rather the Mr. conscience, zoologist will interpret that the elephants eyes can interpret many feelings and she can bleed to death in thinking about the lost of his partner and their eyes gives all the gesture that the heart is thinking of, Mr. Conscience who continually judging you at each step you take perhaps some fox had sell their conscience and make their heart stronger than the ozone layer, no matter the guilt there don’t feel it, funny as it may sound at some point  heaven has it that what you sow so shall you reap it only gives time, even if you take a choice or a step that is good with a bad motive toward it the defined result will tell your actual mind set toward it, so pause rethink, adjust, create a new learn from the past mistake, make it right, like king David in the bible who is scripted as next to God heart, describe as the great king also who make great decision that does not mean he is blend to be making great decision because sometime he make wrong choice but when he realize it a mistake he quit and make a choice never to return to it. 
        The following are steps to known if the choices you have taken in right or wrong
        
        1.	WHAT DO PEOPLE SAY ABOUT YOU
        People are the main material of Life that why the creator never fail to make the availability of human in the planet, as importance that human beings are in the world spending time with the wrong people in the waste of time to our generation. As we think who we are, we are in a canvassing atmosphere with ourselves, People personality is often build by reputation in the heart of others, over 90% of who we are is decided by people around us, that is to say we all deserves one another in one way or the other either directly or indirectly.
        Biblically we are told of the Christ that is Jesus of Nazareth, who is the world greatest teacher, mentor once ask his disciples, “Who do people say I am”. Mark 8:27-30, he was Christ the savior of the world so said the prophecies of the Christian people yet he ask his disciples “who do people say I am” not that he was unable to know who he was but to know the opinion of people about his existence, the inner person in him is known by the outer world of his outer self. Like people will say our reputation is build and develop on what people say about us, with that we are truly define on the planet earth because our integrity has the mouth piece to our social stand in the society even though is not possible for others to know our inner self yet there is a being who has break the record, who can tell you, your inner self, your outer self and the occurrence yet to occur. A better part of you is highly analyze by what people say about you that is why people will say show me your friends and I will tell you who you are. This aspect is painted in different occasion some occasion people wrongly define you because they see the outside not the inside, that is to say some people behalf bad to make people think that there are bad depending on the circumstance they stand with, it may be a situation that might call for such. The making of people to wrongly define you in the way there see you is also a choice but those that define you from the inside are those who truly have your details to tell still quoting from the scripture (Bible) of the Christian of Jesus asking his disciple “who do people said I am” mind you several answers were giving by the disciple, to what he ask them; some say you are the prophet; and Jesus continue by asking them, who do you say I am but Peter said you are Christ the son of God, Christ said respond that this was review to you by my heavenly father that is to verify the Peter was able to define Jesus from the inside not the outside of the miracle he perform perhaps this was possible by that being who review the true self of Christ to him.
        
        
        2.	DECISION IN CHOICE?
        is my decision in accordance with my choice?
        You cannot start the next page of life when you are rereading the previous page, you cannot be you when you are seeing another person, in several context Decision and Choice may mean the same concept to you hence this two have different inner mind thought. The Decision you make may last one or two days but when is now constant may be five to ten years of your existence then is now a choice you have made out from you Decision. Just as is your decision to be brushing your tooth every day but is a choice to know when to brush them either in the morning only or in the evening or not at all. The fact that you agreed never to give up that does not make you exceptional is just the decision you have took which thousands and one reason can make you change you mind, it is more dangerous to agree not to and still not making effort to change or giving reasons not to.
         For you will be trap in your Pains forever, is you are building sky scrapper on the air, that is where choice comes in, for it is your choice not to give up and no matter the pleasure of Chains you faced you still have a reason to continue the 
         Decisions as it was said earlier is two side to a coin in the game of choice, the decision you take stand to make a good or bad choice in the nearness future, is your quest of choice or the judgment you make in conjunction to what you have already have is a plus after thinking what next?
        Every often our decision does not blend in with our choice, I can remember when I made the decision of learning programming, yet my heart never open my heart to accept it whole heartily as a choice perhaps at some point I saw it exhausting and confuse, this poke me to have many excuses to why I want to stop the lesson is obvious that my decision for learning programming was not really my choice just a decision I took, may be what most have influence me in that moment of time to make such decision but if this two (Decision and choice) were synchronizes then I will have not given reason to give excuse. Making a choice of not spending most of your time doing things that are not profitable or time consuming without achieving a purpose for the day, be it as it may every decision, each day was gear into that line of thought even though at some point you might take others people priority for yourself but at the end that should not break you perhaps be as an achievement set for yourself 
        When this two are blend together is easy to work with and is easily achievable than when there are in possible opposite side. Set your goals right, make it to work in accordance with your choice, it is more heart breaking when you make decision that is not working with you choice 
        3.	WHERE ARE YOU GOING? 
        The destination of every traveler is the very beginning of his journey not having the idea of where you are going is like an infant who is carried on the shoulder to any direction even if he or she don’t want to but has no option but to follow. Many have see themselves walking in the path of other taking it to be the best for them not knowing that there is more better to behold than the other that there have spend ages in coping “In order to move forward in life, you must acknowledge your pain and recognize your needs and tend to your suffering soul” (T.D Jakes). We  frequently prepared for the wrong destination on reaching the very point which we think is the right path turn out to be the very worst moment of our life, this have not break you down but given you the opportunity to act better in the path that is meant for you easier on that you ignore. When travelling the road of destiny very negativity should be put on hold still you reach the location not forgetting that there is a time in your life that negativity is necessary to take but not the very moment you are on tract
        
        
        
        4.	WHO ARE YOU
        Defining our essence in this struggling plane is what make us to know the choice to take, not knowing who you are is the very point wrong choices crippled in the heart that is ignorant of what he or she has is let alone excelling in this life were there all way ghost in the skin. It is important to put the right action along the road you are heading life with faith, the grace and the enthusiasm to achieve. ‘God has put in us dreams in every one of our hearts. We all have things for which we are believing- perhaps you are believing to overcome an illness believing to get out of debt or believing to achieved your dream’(Joel Osteen). The dream we have of our self-make us the unique begin and the define the range we can fulfill them
