    <em>NOTHING IS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN RISKING EVERTHING FOR NOTHING</em>
    
    <h5>Understanding yourself

        Talking about yourself lets first of all talk about you
        
        The new year came with a new struct and a better story of a good expectation, i was about starting a new hope after the first the one that I illustrated in the first book title Take the Chain and live the pain, I thought the battle is over and having a new page of what I left behind and a hope for greater things ahead. 
        About the first week of July 2021. I woke up in the clouded hour of the blessed morning about 7:30am of Nigeria during the working week, waking with the gloomy look from a sleepy face, a sudden ache from the lower abdomen which I took from and went for pain killer drugs to reduce the pains.
        After returning from the office, at De Paul Secondary School under the control on the Vincentian priest where I serve as a Sign Language teacher, on reaching home to behold the face of my bed I felt about abdominal pain which I attribute to have not eating, struggling with the pains, I notice about factor of the changes in me where I frequently go and use the toilet (urinating) and more persistent at night the I know something was wrong.
        That was another face of my journey to receive another medical, series of test and scan were conducted to ascertain what is wrong with me, the result came out but never a good one, as I was diagnosed Bladder outlet obstructions which was showing distended bladder with the symptom of ………. Of my both kidney, this has been the illment I faced as a child and also as a teenager and now it has shown faced his ugly face again. 
        This became a devastated moment of my life where I was expecting a turn. This is the point I notice Mr depression cribbing in, this was the moment where Mental stress has a role to play in me, were everybody around started to pull out his or her suggestion to the remedy of the sickness 
        The pronoun “You” and its possessive form ‘your’ explain in detailed who we are, what we are makeup of, what make us different from others, why we act the way we do, what is the inner fire that burn in us, the unique shadow of our human body and what make us greater, stronger, braver in the face of adversary. 
        It is you that make the decision to rule the thought in you.
         YOU
        YOU; I mean you reading the book, what is that feature in you that you call yourself, 
        "You" what is the inner name you bear, what are you known for? what do you live for, what is the memory that you will be remembered for, that which makes you different from the other people in the world, for me I’m different because of you.
        
        
        ‘‘You are the other vessel of something, that part of you that try not to be yet you still find yourself in that very point you thought is over still playing the gallery, the potential that is in you yet unknown’’.
        
        Pastor Chris Onyekilomia will say; “you are the subject to your name” the ability to bear your name is a virtue to stand and defend, your name is another creature buried in you. My kid sister who now rest in the host of angels with her creator, will at each point remind us that she is the governor of herself a unique child of herself she was born 3:00pm, die few minutes after 3:00pm, and was buried about 3:00pm the next day. The most credible and remarkable thing about her was she keeps smiling even when she was punished, she never hid her feeling, she never kept silent to what she knows was right and she believed that she can do it even when she can’t, one scenario about her is her journey to the land of the death, the fact that she is still a child but has great value for herself and to the point of her death she knew that she was not going to live. She turns to her elder sister and told her she is feeling as if she is going to die and after few minutes of her statement, she dies, how this happen is a space of minutes determining her faith, she make choice in a short time and in a short space she lives, her memory still grow fresh on her pear lips where she was remembered at least ones a week. It’s difficult to understand it while a child of her age was so curse in making great choice. These is one word that looks easy to use but too real to imagine. We have all face our chains from one step of life to the other yet we refuse to take them and live the pain, most time we appoint blames on others for our failures, just as Akon once sang ‘Blames on me’ on the verse he said this life goes on and I start to learn more about responsibility…, why does anybody don’t want to take blame? Human like to accord blames on others even though is all their fault: Biblically that was why Adam refused to admit his fault when God called him in the garden of Eden as quoted in the Holy Book of the Genesis rather his respond was “is it not the woman you gave to me that made me to eat of the fruit you forbit”
        Don’t we think is time to accept all your fault, accept the fate of others and try to improve, 
        choices are not determined by our age, for age has nothing to do with choice making it’s only differed in the rationale behind it
        We are connoted by our self, which can be use in several sentences;
        You will be great 
        You will be successful in your struggle
        You are my favorite 
        You are the best in class
        You will fail
        You have made a mistake
        You are the reason why I fail
        You are the reason why he is at the top
        ‘You are’’ endless to use, believed it that we will never use the negative words because we feel is not meant for us rather the next-door neighbor who we feel is too lazy to excel, we can only use these words when FEAR crib to our bones. People miss judge our action because to them it was not necessary not knowing the intention of it, just as Immanuel Kant will say right or wrong is determine by what God state as right and what is wrong……In one of his theory Immanuel Kant categorical Imperative 
        Most time we are scare of what we think might hurt us or tie us down, be over protective is one tool for failure while the things that seem unharmful may press out vain out of our skin and the things harmful we see them as food for the soul, it’s better we make use of the negative words and work hard to achieved the positive words too. for instance, ‘You fail’ if you fail then you need to make it right the next time so as to be in the list of the winners in the race were everybody is a challenger, the racer is your friend, your friend is your choice and she is confused as the owner who happens to be you. You will have to race well in making good choice perhaps the more you race the more serious things become.
        I came to a point in life where I saw myself unworthy of setting things, putting myself in the shell where impossibilities were the cup of water that I use to drink seeing my disability as shame, as I walk down the street seeing people looking and laughing at the way, I walk the way my physical appearance was, I was stock in the room where I saw myself as the worst being ever, then I defined myself with a limit, in a boundary that is not far from home in the cage where I and my room were the best partner. The worst I did was regretting why am that way in the family of ten sibling looking totally different in every way, questioning the creator severally why I was that way, little thing got me crying and the word frequently ringing in me was ‘is because you are physically challenged, that’s why you are treated differently’ then I was about six to ten of age in the primary school, the depression became more pressing because in the environment I saw myself. I was crush, in tears just the way people see me perhaps the main hit was simply because I was the only human with such a feature. My case was not just the physical look also with a health challenge, with my loving mother at the receiving end also, where the hospital became my rest net where I must be admitted into the hospital yearly on same issue that surfaced his ugly face in several ways, I wept severally, prayed several times for a miracle, it continued until I was about ten or eleven years old, although I was facing other emotional torment while at home. I can never forget this day that my thought changed, the end of my beginning, the reverse of the world of dark walls in me into a lamp of light, the twist of the clock, to the path I wanted it, that point I loved myself then I use these words ‘I must win’. My mother was the brain behind my reverse she said this words to me while at the Calabar General Hospital laying at the hospital bed, at the year 2006 around the month of July where major operation was done on me of a urinal problem which I was already operated upon when I was nine month of year, were I lay straight on the bed for over six month, she said this words to my ears as she was cleaning me up in the morning with this wonderful smile, and my kid sister( Divine) on her arms, she said ‘junior you are the best thing that has ever happened to me, no matter the way you are the way people laugh at you that is the main reason I love you the more because you have made me popular, you have taken me to several place, is it churches or hospital you have taught me that life in not bed of roses at some point we will face rocks, you have given me reason to believe that God is really a miracle worker, in ten thousand children who may be physical correct and okay you will be the same child I will prefer because you are unique among the thousand that show their face, so stop crying, you will go back to school after you have been discharged even if your mate might go ahead of you’. Looking at the smile of my kid sister on her arms and the smile she gave me while washing my body with towel, this brought tears to my eyes and stared a strong outer munition within me and shook my head and at that moment I accepted myself the way I am. Words that first struck my mind was ‘‘Godwin you are the best, and unique one among the thousands of children who are laughing at you’’.
         That moment everything about me turned around in the way I never thought, situation of things started with me a bright light, suddenly my eyes started showing me others kids with disability and their condition were ten times worse than mine which I never saw, properly on their path they may be wishing that they should be like me for my own case is better; at least I was able to walk, talk, write. Believe it or not after that moment things change because I had another thought about life even at school my grade changed to the fact that I was among the two-best student during my schooling days from college to higher institution to most levels, I was the best. The number of my friends increase above many students in the school, the company of my friends were far more than a football team, people who never saw me as their class members, therefore impossible things became possible, the number of people laughing at me reduced over fifty percent. On the singular fact that I accepted myself the way I am and started doing my best to be me perhaps to let my immediate environment to know that I have a purpose in life, to also have a say in the society and the world at large just as Helen Killer, Nick Vucci……., etc. That only became possible as the words of my mother created another widow in me, the very me I never saw, a door that was lock for years. 
        The choice I took that was availing my shorting comings, creating my doom in the silence of ‘fear’ not to be mock by others, seeing myself as a liability instead of an asset. that FEAR that fenced everything about me into a small world shell in the dark little space. I took another choice to love myself no matter the things I faced or see as I drive through this journey on earth.
        Most time is necessary to be you. Is the essence of seeing yourself as you and appreciating the way the creator created you, for it is for a purpose?
        You are who you are, you the very reason that things happen the way the are happening for human are known for happening and doing. 
        
        
        ‘‘YOUSELF’’
        ‘‘It is a ghost success that plays a music of success to us even though is a dream yet to be achieved, when we are not scrambling for it’’
        
        You can’t be yourself when you are still another person.
        You can’t be a vessel of something else, the part of another hold yet you still find yourself in that very point you thought is over rather is the beginning, the potential that is in you is unknown to the world. Very often we are familiar with “Be yourself” which is the psalmist for inspirational teachers to anchor on, this is one statement that have fly a long way to the gallery yet nothing changes from the actual meaning it was designed for, nothing seems to make us feel unique except “pride” we keep rolling in the path of others coping their successes to ours as copycat that we are.
        I could remember Mr Saa Aondo Stephen Benue state Nigeria, giving a class lecture and ending it by saying “to be a good student and choice-oriented student you must attend lectures, do assignment, do assessment and read your book regularly” you must believe in yourself not allowing anybody to live your life for you, 
        We reflect in the mirror like the reflection of the trees in the waters yet the tree can’t stand without the sand for our next page is at the very point of our feet yet our eyes travel like the giraffe above the shrub of the earth, who can’t find his immediate problems within except the fantasy of nature ahead, not finding our problems within ours foot make us to lay blames on others who are just a player at the first place.
        You must believe in yourself not allowing others to live your life for you, no man has the key to control the decisions we make there only play a role by analyzing their past experience to aim us   in making a better choice giving you the liberty to take the chain of making a good decision for yourself and live with the pain, the regret or joy that comes from it, having fate in the activities we do makes us human. Our differences from other animal is not that we are human but because we share in guilt, conscience, and empathy.
        Researches as presented human as success fighter, ambition seeker, curiosity builder, millions in thousands give up to the very point the chain show up his ugly head. Some few minutes section with Nkanu Philip; he uses the thirty percent of his studies time to know on how to make money yet he feels that money is not everything, Chidera Onyedika a student of Grammar School Odoni, Bayelsa State, Nigeria, believed that all he needs should be provided by his parent not for him to work for it, for his father has do the home work still he blames his father of being poor when his mate has made it in life, himself fail to know that everybody opts to struggle for himself. This are two group of people in different world; one wanting something but not seeing it as a necessity the other putting blame on his father but refuse to work for his own rather depend on very father that he blames, what an irony of life a twist of faith
        The world is changing; they are reason why Aristocrat develop weak chains, the metal race we face daily is the very point of our existence to appreciation the native creativity of God in creating his people which he called my own image and likeness. 
        We are channel to various paths in life, some path is double cross with multiple roads, and some are parallel to each other but the joy is the path is endless the very end is just the beginning so at some point you need to change to the path that works with you. Looking beyond your mirror is the essences of life for it help you to see beyond your limit, God virtue for us is like a growing tree that keep growing tall if she has it nutrient to the brim, she keeps growing but if it’s begins to lack nutrient, its growth is reduce and his texture is lost
        Sir Jacob Kpeese of the De Paul Secondary School, Oraifite Anambra, Nigeria, gave a picture of himself as a very hard-working father who want to achieved much for himself and his family still, he refuses to see opportunities and work with them rather seeing his negative strength, as a barrier, very often we expect much from life and wish to have everything to our comfort not lacking any things but unknowing to us that we most lack one or two things in life so that we can appreciate the gift nature has given us   
         Natalie Wambui of Kenyan once said if seventy five percent people of Kenyan are writing all the negative things about Kenyan shouldn’t why, I should write on the very positive wants for our people not to lose hope on their country Kenyan and see what others fails to put into writing
        You can’t continue been like others or doing what others are doing hence you can single yourself out from the crowd and make a stand. The cat is called a cat because of his uniqueness to do unique thing by standing on a particular position without leaving for over twenty minutes 
        You possess that key to your happiness the master minder of your choice, the key owner of your life the reason why things work the way you see them, we only need the support of others to help achieved that which you wish, as I illustrate about myself above my mom only supported me to achieved the who in me, what my inner fire that was burning within that I can’t see, for which I never discover about myself, the words of my mother might be use by several mother to their children or even better words or more inspirational wants than the wants my mom use with me; is about the will not just the word, is about the impact not just the comfort: is about you not the you that is living for others to see.  
        Make an impact on the received advice you have been given because it is the opener of your heart perhaps you can’t say that you have not receive advice before hence every breathing human has receive advice not once and not twice but we only turn a blind eye, is it you that own the heart which is the  inner ball that kick any time for the receiver, it has a food for the soul, even as I write and hoping for many to read but this might not make impact to many that may read it and many will not have still to it, some  will only say I have already try those words thousand time nothing happen, I have read lots of book about this and there he is using them again. Remember that no pain no gain
          The duration that our catacomb enjoys in the grave yard seem to please the grave because thousands of potentials are lay down yearly for him to feed on and they never come back again buried with their potential forever.
        
        Hearing messages is different from the message making a change in us that why we have many Christians who hear the words of the great teacher Jesus Christ yet has nothing to show in them, that why when Christ himself was preaching in the temple many heard what he taught but nothing change in them and this was a great teacher that the world have not broken his record yet, rather we all build in the wisdom he has taught. Let’s use the case of  Apostle Peter in the bible as a lesson in this teaching of this section, when Christ told him that he was going to denial him three time, Peter regret to accept it until when he denial Christ in the present of  servants, what did he do; he ran like many who will run away for their shame perhaps he took it as a challenge to correct himself and came back although at first he never understood that it pays to listen to great teacher teaching using it to make a change not just reacting but allowing it to make a change in us, just as Judea Iscariot who never bear his, he ran just as Peter did, the difference is he ran to hang himself, the mistake we make is for the better for when you miss a step then you take another that why is call mistake a change for the better, a change that will bring out the real virtue we were created for.
        We all are created for different reason; to accomplish, to achieved, to fulfill, to support, to teach, to correct, to build, to kill, to change others, to fight others to make them hold again, not for us just to make wealth, have authority over others, oppressing those that don’t have somebody or something to show for also to say a word for them, seeing the poor as useless, the physical challenge as cruse; remember that you can’t spell useless without using that same word USE, also remember everything we have today was just an idea from something or someone else idea; the cars, houses, clothes, shoes, bags, bike, ship, electricity, etc came as an idea from some gentlemen or women or a being. Don’t see yourself as less important hence that word was not meant for you its only there to motivate you to be a better person.
        Been yourself may be the best thing you can do for yourself loneliness is the worst thing you can imagine so don’t do it
