    <h1> FEAR </h1>
    
    <h5> FEAR
        Mr Fear, he is so brave and courageous that war Lordâ€™s tremble when HE Crips in, he is so real, close to us even more than the air we breathe, he lives everywhere even in the deepest secret of our heart, we try to avoid him every time but he Lodge to lunch a missile to our weakness and make our strength silence yet we can't escape because doubt make us feel that Fear is stronger than us.
        Who is he that can't be overcome?
        We are so clone to fear that he takes greater part of us allowing us to join our ancestor without achieving good virtue of us making our potential food for termites.
        Some people are born thieves there stole their way from their woman womb, even stealing from the creator, stealing what; breakthrough, success, blessing etc using what to steal brevity and prayers, then some idiot will sit with their jealousy and be gossiping when you succeed.

        Some people are born thieves there stole their way from their woman womb, even stealing from the creator, stealing what; breakthrough, success, blessing etc using what to steal prayers, then some idiot will sit with their jealousy and be gossiping when you succeed. Fear is your jealousy, she gossip about your success so steal your way out from Fear, pray for strength
        You need no time to overcome fear still no lastingness to think of time, we need courage and focus, no time to think of fear as a friend to humanity perhaps Fear is a better version of success if you can put fear aside.
        For the infinity of our existence gives us worries about the destiny that lies ahead. Been scared is part of Man and have live as long man exist in the planet, following the biblical version of the creation of the world we see the role that fear play in the heart of man making mankind feeling that she is inferior even to himself. From the Genesis in the creation of the world, after mankind has been created, we see Adam feeling that he is alone even though he was surrounded by many virtues of life and the beauty of nature, the creative nature of the wild animals yet he was afraid that he was alone, after the woman was carve out of him. At the other hand the woman who came out of Man took the part of the man called FEAR where she was deceive by the serpent in eating the forbidden fruit because she felt that she was losing something the fear that she was not the first in the line of wisdom made her to fall for the trick play by the serpent to disobey God.
        Man on his actual fear never want to be punish alone had to blame God in creating the woman be hiding himself for the fear for God not to see him, as God call on him, he became afraid to tell the truth rather telling God he was hiding. 
        KIND OF FEAR
        In rating fear, she is rated according the individual who perceive it in his or her own way, rating from 10% to 100, we place them in two significant kind and the role the two play in us;
        Positive fear and Negative Fear
        Positive fear; It is the productive fear, this is the natural fear we inherit from the gene of our parent, that subdue the mind of settle things, yet you still try to do it. for instance, the entrepreneur spirit, having the deal to do something but the fear of risk makes him to hold back but if he let it go and give a try to the risk he is about to take, he makes awesome to the top, this a people who learn listen to their heart, act in accordance with their believe and frighten with their eyes.
        This is the extend that fear can work in us making us not to have confidence in ourselves
        We are so clone to fear that he takes greater part of us allowing us to join our ancestor without achieving good virtue of us. making us potential food for termites.
        Some people are born thieves there stole their way from their woman womb, even stealing from the creator, stealing what; breakthrough, success, blessing etc using what to steal brevity and prayers, then some idiot will sit with their jealousy and be gossiping when you succeed. Fear is your jealousy, she gossip about your success  so steal your way out from Fear, giving you the picture that you can't do it, you can't make it..
