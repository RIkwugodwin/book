    <em>NOTHING IS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN RISKING EVERTHING FOR NOTHING</em>
    <h1> INTRODUCTION </h1>
    
            <h5> 
                Those few lines of words gather, open the mind to view things better than they opt to present themselves. Choice is one disease that have problem with our physiology and psychology for long, it has chain us into the world of dilemma, with better or no chance to change, the disease is yet to keep off from the heart of men, our daily breath is occupy with things to achieve and grow beyond measure, though it has eaten up the little sense of self confidence and make us less important to ourselves. 
        
                The pronoun “You” and its possessive form “your” explain in detailed who we are, what we are makeup of, 
                what make us different from others, 
                the uniqueness of our being, 
                why we act the way we do, 
                what is the inner fire that burn in us? 
                the unique shadow of our human body and what make us greater, stronger, braver in the face of adversary. 
                It is you that make the decision to rule the thought in you, the idea powered by the choice we make which we live on and depend on, the chain we take in life and the pain we should let go for good, our thought as human is differently built even twin thinks different.
               we don’t work we feel we should achieve, despite it has eaten up the little sense of self confidence and make us less important to ourselves yet she has not supersite the totality of our conformity.
                This has chain us in the world were we know nothing of greatest except the physical gift we see materialising in the cupcake of wealth, giving to us to take, to feed our subsensory mind and letting the pain to erosion away hence is in taking the chain and living the pains that is the virtue that life seem to play with
        
                The moment of tears doses not define who you are but how well you can navigate through challenges and still have a cause to appreciate those being, that gave you time to beat the speed of time to let it go.
                The hill of life has push us many times to give up on yourself, just as Joel Osteen will say “stretching to the next level. Keep pressing forward”. Have a reason to live for. Have a purpose to stand with. Have a dream to visualize. Have a goal to work with. Have a faith to trust on the supreme, supernatural being called God. Have the slight to see beyond your limit. Have the enthusiasm to work. Have the mindset that you will make it. Have the spirit hold on to something valuable.
                Believe it with me that you are not the only person on this planet earth since the great blast of the universe. You are just the version of it. You are just the other side of what the universal body is facing. Don’t feel yours is worst or better than the other person because we all work just in the space of time that we are all design for.
                Just as your heart have not stop beating, just as the clock has not stop ticking, just as bad thing keeps happening, just as the sun is still up and the moon comes thereof, just as people are still given birth and mosquitoes still lives, then you have to start something. Don’t allow the pass to judge your present, rather let your present define your future and your future define you.
                don’t mind what there say or do, just do what you say and what you can do because people must talk; in bad and in good people must talk. Don’t attached your failure to witchcraft and sorcerer manipulation, am not saying there exist am only saying that there don’t have the totality of your conformity, you know why because they only touch your body not your soul, your soul is yours to keep for the great master, teacher has given you authority over all duties and the firmament of your heart and soul to toil with
                It is you that make the decision to rule the thought in you, the idea powered by the choice we make which we live on and depend on, the chain we take in life and the pain we should let go for good, our thought as human is differently built even twin thinks different.
                 Choice is one disease that have problem with our physiology and psychology for long, it has chain us into the world of dilemma, with better or no chance to change or let go the pain, the disease is yet to keep off from the heart of men, daily our breath is occupy with things to achieve and grow beyond measure even though we don’t work we feel we should achieve, despite it has eaten up the little sense of self confidence and make us less important to ourselves yet she has not supersite the totality of our conformity.
                This has chain us into the world where we know nothing of greatest except the physical gift we see materializing in the cupcake of wealth, giving to us to take, to feed our subsensory mind and letting the pain to erosion our thought away hence is in taking the chain and living the pains that is the virtue that life seem to play with
                The reason why we still wine with the chain we faced, is! The fact that no pain no gain just as we were told, just Adam Smith in the 18 century that human wants are insatiable so as your chain for they keep coming hence you have the liberty to live the pain.
                Knowing the fact that you have a weakness is the reason you have to see through life for it is more appreciated when you have a weakness and make a strength out of it, though it might be exhausting but that is the very essence of life perhaps craving strength through your weakness.
