    <h1> ACKNOWLEDGEMENT </h1>
    <h5>
        I give thanks to God for the success throughout the struggle of
         Scripting an idea into a book, I thank my Big sister Rev. Sis. Clementina Alicha for believing in me no matter the number of times I gave up, the making of a book is a team work of so many people in their own different ways theiy contribution to make the book become a material for reading, I acknowledge Mr. Stephen Saa Aondo, for his motivation that I should use my pen, Mr. Bem Targema for his creative spirit in me of starting small no matter the cost/course I will face.
        to the host of others that their names not mention but my heart keep the record of them in every bit of what they have contribute in my life toward this book.
        I will not forget the three wise men that get my feet up in making the idea into book page
